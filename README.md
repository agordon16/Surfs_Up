# Surfs_Up
## Overview
Analyze weather data provided to determine if proposed surf and ice cream shop will be successful and not suffer due to any unpredictable weather patterns.


## Results
Based on analysis of temperature and precipitation for two time periods spaced six months apart, the following observations were noted:
* June temperatures are, on average, slightly higher than December

* December precipitation amounts are, on average, higher than June

* While temperatures remained relatively steady for both months, precipitation amounts being higher in December could suggest that this might not be a good month for business       as it has the potential of having more rainy days.

## Summary
Based on temperature alone, both times of year tend to have temperatures that are upwards of 74 degrees which bodes well for the surf and ice cream shop. The primary thing to consider would be precipitation in December (or winter in general) as the shop could get rained out during this time of year. When reviewing the results this information could guide you and your investors to think more about when the ideal months to keep the shop open would be.
